# Delayed Oil Transfer
---
### PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Objective**
This project investigate the root of delay in the oil transfer and propost strategic solution plan. through data analysis of operational workflows, resources allocation, and process efficiency, this project seeks to identify trends and key area of improvements.

**Scope**
The analysis covers:
+ current transfer and handling protocols
+ staffing and equipment utilisation patterns
+ service delay patterns and external influencing factors
+ operational bottlenecks and improvement oppurtunities

  **Methodology**
+ **Data collection** gathering logs, equipment status, and service records.
+ **Analysis** Identifying delay trends and correlating with operational factors.
+ **Root cause Analysis:** Diagnosing delay contributions
+ ***Solution proposal:** Reccommeding solution, such as process optimisation and resource allocation.

  **Data Source**
  The data set was provided by the clientas a CSV
