# Delayed Oil Transfer
---
### PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Objective**
This project investigate the root of delay in the oil transfer and propost strategic solution plan. through data analysis of operational workflows, resources allocation, and process efficiency, this project seeks to identify trends and key area of improvements.

**Scope**
The analysis covers:
+ current transfer and handling protocols
+ staffing and equipment utilisation patterns
+ service delay patterns and external influencing factors.
+ operational bottlenecks and improvement oppurtunities.

  **Methodology**
+ **Data collection** gathering logs, equipment status, and service records.
+ **Analysis** Identifying delay trends and correlating with operational factors.
+ **Root cause Analysis:** Diagnosing delay contributions
+ ***Solution proposal:** Reccommeding solution, such as process optimisation and resource allocation.

***
   **Data Source**
  The data set was provided by the clientas a CSV file, which was downloaded and processed for analysis.

  ***
  **Tools**
  + **microsoft Excel:** utilises for preliminary data correction and initial review of the dataset.
  + **SQL Server:** Employed for data cleaning and in-depth analysis to extract meaningful insights.
  + **Power BI:** used to visualise insights and provide detailes, interactive reports.

    ExploratoryData Analysis (EDA)
    In this EDA, we will excercise the human resource dataset to address key operational questions that can impact the efficiency and reliability of all transfer services. these insight will help identify potential areas for improvement ands facilitate data-driven decision-making.

    ***Key Questions to Address**
    1. Total Number of Truck drivers
       + Determine the number of truck drivers to assess if current staffing meets operational demands.
    2. Number of efficient trucks
       + identify the counts of trucks classification efficients to understand the potential operational constraints.
    3. Coverage Areas (Distances in kilometers)
       + Analyze distance covered to evaluate the geographic area.
    4. Truck Breakdown and maintenance frequency
       + Assess the frequency of truck breakdown and scheduled maintenance.

    These insioghts from EDA will contribute to optimising workforce planing, improving fleet management, and enhancing the overall efficiency of all transfer services.
